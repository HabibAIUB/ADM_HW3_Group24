# ADM_HW3_Group24
# FindAMasters.com Search Engine Project

## Overview
This GitHub repository contains the code and documentation for a group project undertaken as part of the ADM (Algorithmic Methods for Data Mining) course. The project focuses on crawling the FindAMasters.com website and implementing different search engines using various metrics, such as inverted index, TF-IDF cosine similarity, and a custom-defined scoring function.

## Project Structure
1. **Crawling and Preprocessing:** The initial phase involved crawling data from FindAMasters.com and preprocessing the obtained information to create a structured dataset.

2. **Search Engine Implementation:** The project includes the development of search engines based on inverted index, TF-IDF cosine similarity, and a novel scoring function. Users can input text queries to retrieve relevant MSc degree information.

3. **Custom Scoring Function:** A unique scoring function is introduced to enhance the ranking of MSc degrees. The function considers various variables, including the description field and additional dataset attributes.

4. **Visualization:** The repository includes tools for visualizing the most relevant MSc degrees on a map. The visualization incorporates city and country information, allowing users to plan their academic careers more effectively. The map also includes a legend representing the associated fees for each course. example msc_map.html in repository.

## How to Use
1. **Crawling and Preprocessing:** Execute the crawling scripts to obtain the latest data from FindAMasters.com. Preprocess the data to ensure consistency and accuracy.

2. **Search Engines:** Utilize the implemented search engines to retrieve relevant MSc degrees based on different metrics. Compare and analyze the results obtained from each engine.

3. **Custom Scoring Function:** Experiment with the custom scoring function by entering text queries. Evaluate whether the new scoring metric provides improved results compared to previous scoring functions.

4. **Visualization:** Explore the visualization tools to display MSc degrees on a map. Ensure that the map includes information about the location (city and country) and associated fees, providing users with a comprehensive overview.
